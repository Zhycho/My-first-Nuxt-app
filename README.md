# My first Nuxt App

This is my first Nuxt app made with [Create Nuxt App](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app). I learned the main concepts of Nuxt by developing this.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
